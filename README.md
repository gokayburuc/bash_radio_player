## Introduction 

Extremely simple Customizable Internet Radio that runs on your terminal. Select your FM and press enter. The script will do the rest. Sit back and listen to your favorite radio on your terminal screen!

It contains 1000 radio links of Turkish radio stations. You can also add new radio stations by pasting the links of the radios you like into the csv file.

This radio player is the first version that works bare-bones, before plugins. It is open to development with other plugins in future versions. For your new ideas and opinions, you can contact me at gokayburuc@yandex.com.
